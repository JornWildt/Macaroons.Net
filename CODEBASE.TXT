Macaroons.Net
=============

This is a short overview of the classes and methods available in Macaroons.Net.
See also WALKTHROUGH.TXT for a complete introduction to macaroons.

Macaroon
--------
This is the class that represents a single macaroon. You can create new 
instances, add first party as well as third party caveats, serialize and 
deserialize it, inspect it and verify it.

Caveat
------
This class represents a single first party or third party caveat.

Verifier
--------
This class stores valid predicates used to verify macaroons.

Packet
------
This class represents a blob of data, a byte array, together with an encoding
that takes care of converting the data to and from a textual representation.

PacketReader/PacketWriter
-------------------------
These two classes are used to serialize and deserialize macaroons.

DataEncoding
------------
This class represents a textual encoding of a byte array. An encoding can 
convert between byte arrays and strings. Macaroons.Net has an initial set of
encodings available:

- Base64UrlSafeDataEncoding: encoding bytes as BASE64 URL safe strings.
- HexDataEncoding: encoding bytes as hexadecimal strings.
- TextDataEncoding: encoding bytes using different standard text encodings such
  as UTF8 and ASCII.

CryptoAlgorithm
---------------
Represents an algorithm for encrypting and decrypting data. The default 
algorithm is using Secret Box encryption.
